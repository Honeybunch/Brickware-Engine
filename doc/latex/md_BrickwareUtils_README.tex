\subsection*{How to Build}

This repo can be built on its own but is designed to be included as a submodule in another project. The included C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt should work just fine to build the project but has not been tested on its own.

Just invoke C\+Make on the project and then build with Visual Studio, Make or whatever you\textquotesingle{}d like!

\subsubsection*{Dependencies}

None!
