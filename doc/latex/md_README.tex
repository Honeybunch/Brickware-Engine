 

A Simple 3\+D engine in Open\+G\+L+\+Direct\+X and C++ modeled off of Unity3\+D

This is mostly for my own fulfillment and education but if you want to fork or dig through it feel free.

I will probably not accept pull requests for things other than fixing comments or syntax. 



\subsection*{How to Build}

\subsubsection*{Dependencies}

The goal is to have as few dependencies as possible with this project. Right now the list is as such

\paragraph*{Open\+G\+L}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+L\+E\+W
\item G\+L\+F\+W3
\item G\+L core library
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Direct\+X}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Windows 8 S\+D\+K
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Assets}

I have recently removed the Assets folder from the repo as it was adding quite a large chunk of crap data to the repo\textquotesingle{}s history. I suggest editing the {\ttfamily Test\+Game.\+cpp} file in the Brickware\+Test project to load whatever assets you have available. I will keep the shaders available as it would be a pain to write those all out but any models or textures you will have to bring in yourself. If you want to make contributions but don\textquotesingle{}t want to deal with all that I can share my assets with you on Google Drive.

The structure for assets is as such\+: ``` Test\+Build/ Brickware\+Test.\+exe Shaders/ Shaders.\+glsl (or .cso if D\+X11) Textures/ Textures.\+bmp (24 and 32bpp bmps only right now) Models/ Models.\+obj (triangulated objs only) Data/ Data.\+json Logs/ Brickware.\+log (generated by the engine) ```

\subsubsection*{Building}

\paragraph*{Windows}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install C\+Make G\+U\+I
\item Point to your G\+L\+E\+W and G\+L\+F\+W directories
\item Choose a Build directory that works for you
\item Configure for your platform (V\+S 2013 and 2015 tested only)
\item Generate build system
\item Build
\item Make sure all assets are copied into their proper directories
\end{DoxyItemize}

N\+O\+T\+E\+S\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For V\+S you will need to set Brickware\+Test as your startup project and set your Working Directory to \char`\"{}\$(\+Solution\+Dir)\+Test\+Build\char`\"{}
\item D\+X11 Rendering is broken at the moment as I decide whether or not I want to continue to use Direct X at all.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Linux}

Linux has been tested but is still kind of shaky due to the infancy of the C\+Make Project. There are a few extra steps compared to Windows.

This has been Tested on\+:

Debian Testing with X\+F\+C\+E 4, Light\+D\+M, X\+Org 1.\+15 and A\+M\+D proprietary drivers on an A\+M\+D 7970\+M. (As of March 2014)

Antergos Linux with L\+T\+S kernel 3.\+14, Gnome Shell, G\+D\+M, X\+Org 1.\+17 and the Mesa Radeon drivers on an A\+M\+D 7970\+M (As of November 2015)

Ubuntu 15.\+10 with Kernel 4.\+2, Unity, Light\+D\+M and the A\+M\+D Catalyst driver on an A\+M\+D 7970\+M (Current Linux testbed)

Feel free to add any other setups you have that work or do not work

Anyway here are the steps to build


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Clone down the repo somewhere
\item Make sure you\textquotesingle{}ve installed G\+L\+E\+W, G\+L\+F\+W3, C\+Make and Mesa or your proprietary driver.
\item In the repo create a Build directory
\item cd into Build and run cmake \+: {\ttfamily cmake ../}
\item C\+Make should generate the project just fine
\item Run {\ttfamily make -\/j 16}
\item cd into Test\+Build
\item Make sure all assets are copied into their proper directories
\item In Test\+Build you should be able to execute the test with {\ttfamily .\textbackslash{}Brickware\+Test}
\item The shared libraries should also be in Test\+Build
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Mac O\+S\+X}

I do not have a good machine to test any Mac O\+S\+X port on. If you have the X\+Code command line tools installed (g++) you should be able to get away with installing G\+L\+E\+W and G\+L\+F\+W3 with Macports or Brew and follow the steps for Linux. If not then I may need to write some Objective-\/\+C shim.
