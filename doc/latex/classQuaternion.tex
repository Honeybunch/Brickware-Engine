A 4 dimensional representation of rotation.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Quaternion.\+hpp$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
A 4 dimensional representation of rotation. 

This quaternion is represented similarly to a \hyperlink{classVector4}{Vector4} with X, Y, Z and W. It is designed to represent rotations. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
