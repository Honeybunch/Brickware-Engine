 

The Core library for \href{http://github.com/Honeybunch/Brickware-Engine}{\tt Brickware Engine}

If you were to build a game with this you would follow the model in the main engine repo and pull this and its dependencies into a new project as submodules. 



\subsection*{How to Build}

This repo is not meant to be edited on its own but to be included as a submodule in another project. This will not build without being linked against all of the necessary dependencies. The included C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt does not make it easy to setup the project to be built on its own yet.

Yes you do still need to link against the graphics library you\textquotesingle{}re using here and in the project you derive this from because Brickware\+Graphics links dynamically by default.
